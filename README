DESCRIPTION

A custom report for Racktables with list af all cables in the system.

Cables are sorted by default on Cable-ID with the highest on top for easy
access to the next free Cable-ID.

The code is probably not very portable as it's using direct SQL queries
but it works with version 0.20.5 of Racktables.

INSTALLATION

Copy the file ok-cablereport-v3.php into the plugins directory.
The plugins directory is on the same level as Racktables wwwroot directory.
