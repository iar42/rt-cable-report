DESCRIPTION

A custom report for Racktables with list af all cables in the system.

Cables are sorted by Cable-ID with the highest on top for easy access to
the next free Cable-ID.

Cables with the same Cable-ID are treated and displayed as the same line.
For example cables spanning one or more patch panels.

The code is probably not very portable as it's using direct SQL queries
but it works with version 0.20.5 of Racktables.

INSTALLATION

Copy the file all-cables.php into the plugins directory.
The plugins directory is on the same level as Racktables wwwroot directory.
